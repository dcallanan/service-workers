    <h1> Welcome to Flappy Bird!</h1>
	<h3> Play online with your friends and see who can get the best score, or play on your own in singleplayer mode! </h3>
	<div style="width: 300px; height: 500px; background: black; color: #333; font-weight: bold;">This is an example and therefore you can't actually play flappy bird here. Either get it on your phone or head over to flaap.io</div>
