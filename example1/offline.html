	<h1> Welcome to Flappy Bird Offline!</h1>
	<h2> You are not connected to the internet... </h2>
	<h3> You can still play flappy bird locally without internet, but to play with your friends please connect to the internet! </h3>
	<div style="width: 300px; height: 500px; background: black; color: #333; font-weight: bold;">This is an example and therefore you can't actually play flappy bird here. Either get it on your phone or head over to flaap.io</div>
